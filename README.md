# spaceships
2D spaceships arcade-style game

IMPORTANT:
To simply play the game, download the spaceships/debug folder and run the executable "Spaceships.exe"

Consume powerups by colliding with them. Question mark powerups give the player a random bonus, while up-arrow powerups upgrade the user's spaceship.

Some projectiles move slower or faster than others. This is because the projectile's initial velocity is dependent upon that of the spaceship which fired it.

Currently, the highest level I have gotten to is level 9.

CONTROLS:
W: move up
S: move down
A: move left
D: move right
Q: rotate counter-clockwise
E: rotate clockwise
[: fire bullet
]: fire torpedo
