2D spaceships arcade-style game

IMPORTANT:
To simply play the game, download the spaceships/debug folder and run the executable "Spaceships.exe"

Consume powerups by colliding with them. Question mark powerups give the player a random bonus, while up-arrow powerups upgrade the user's spaceship.



OTHER INFO:
Some projectiles move slower or faster than others. This is because the projectile's initial velocity is dependent upon that of the spaceship which fired it.

Currently, the highest level I have gotten to is level 10.

This is still a work-in-progress. Current to-do list:
-clean up powerup situation
-make framerate-related functions dependent on framerate
-make some powerups more rare
-work out maximum values for powerups (the current system is spaghetti and very arbitrary)
-bring more order to the PowerUpFactory
-add more user spaceships
-give levels more variety
-add powerups which give the player new abilities
-make levels less about attacking hordes of enemies and more about the challenge

CONTROLS:
W: move forward (up)
S: move back (down)
A: move left
D: move right
Q: rotate counter-clockwise
E: rotate clockwise
[: fire bullet
]: fire torpedo
