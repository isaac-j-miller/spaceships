2D spaceships arcade-style game

DISCLAIMER:
All assets are stolen from Google Images and will be replaced with original content or properly acquired content later.

IMPORTANT:
To simply play the game, download the spaceships/release folder and run the executable "Spaceships.exe"
(This should work, but I am not sure if some of the dependencies are properly linked)

Consume powerups by colliding with them. Question mark powerups give the player a random bonus, while up-arrow powerups upgrade the player's spaceship.

OTHER INFO:
Some projectiles move slower or faster than others. This is because the projectile's initial velocity and trajectory is dependent upon that of the spaceship which fired it.

This is still a work-in-progress. Current to-do list:

-clean up powerup situation

-make some powerups more rare

-work out maximum values for powerups (the current system is spaghetti and very arbitrary)

-bring more order to the PowerUpFactory

-add more user spaceships

-add lasers

-maybe tweak gravitational constant

-get new artwork?

CONTROLS:

W: accelerate forward

S: accelerate back

A: accelerate left

D: accelerate right

Q: rotate counter-clockwise

E: rotate clockwise

[: fire bullet

]: fire torpedo

;: lay mine
